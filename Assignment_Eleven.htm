      <h1 class="w3-text-blue">Project Eleven</h1>
        <p>This project I feel did a good job covering alot of material relitivly quickly. For me I have experience coding in c++ and in arduino, so this wasn't really a whole lot of new things. It was still pretty interesting though.</p>
        <h2 class="w3-text-blue">Video One</h2>
        <p>The first video was basically Kevin walking us through what tinkercad circuits is. We set up an LED which is a light emmitting diode. That means that it is a diode, has two terminal and conducts energy in one direction, that also produces light. We also made a button which does what you've seen buttons do. You press them, and it allows current to pass through it in a different way then usual. We also used a petitiometer which is basically a resistor that you can change the resistance of by spinning it. Oh and I almost forgot we found out that you need to use resistors or else you blow up your LEDs because the current will be too high.</p>

        <h2 class="w3-text-blue">Video Two</h2>
        <p>This video was all about coding in arduino. It is very similar to coding in c++. I have experience coding in both of these so this video was just a nice reminder. A variable is just a place to store information. In code you can do all of the mathematical operations that you can do with a calculator. The only ones we cared about in the video are +,-,*,/ and %. % is called module, and it basically finds the remainder when divided by a number. We also did basic logical operations. The ones we cared about are if and else. These do what there name says if(statement=something) then it does what a command else it does some other command.</p>

        <h2 class="w3-text-blue">Video Three</h2>
        <p>For video three we just combined the coding and the building of a cicuit.</p>

        <h2 class="w3-text-blue">I Know How To Code</h2>
        <p>For the assignment that you wanted us to write some code so that you would know that I know how to write code. So I I wrote a for loop with a if, else, if else, with some basic math stuff thrown in there including a module. It's just a thing that is going to count for a while with different conditions depending on wether the number is even or odd.</p>

        <h2 class="w3-text-blue">Coding Assignment One</h2>
        <p>This assignment we wanted to make sure that when you pressed a button several LED's would turn on then off in a sequential order from left to right. This was just having a bunch of LED's plugged into the arduino so that you can have it turn off and on depending on a button push.</p>

        <h2 class="w3-text-blue">Coding Assignment Two</h2>
        <p>This assignment was just a little coding thing that was meant to count to keep track of how many seconds have passed. It is in the loop section with a counter value that increases everytime it goes through. Once it counts there is an if else statement to check if it's a multiple of 5 if it is it prints John otherwise it prints the value stored in the counter.</p>
